How to run the program?
	python scheduling_ILP.py XXX.g XXX.cm
	I've attached sm.g and sm.cm for you to test the program. The minimum latency should be 5

Program flow:
	scheduling_ILP.py first parses XXX.g and XXX.cm files to 
	build up an internal data strucutre representing the data flow graph and 
	mapping cost. It then calls ILPSolver.py to write out the ILP formation of the problem. 
	Then IBM CPLEX solver qcpex.py is called in ILPSolver.py to solve the ILP formation.

Input File Format
	XXX.g : this file specifies the structure of the data flow graph
		Dependencies between nodes are indicated by arrow symbols. For example, 
		"n1 -> n4" means node "n4" is dependent on node "n1".

	XXX.cm : this file specifies resource information and mapping information
		A resource is described by four space-separated parameters: name, latency, number, area,
			Name : the name of the resource
			Latency : the number of clock cycles that the resource takes to execute an operation
			Number : the maximum number of the resource that can be used simultaneously. 
			Area : the area taken to built the resource.
		Mapping information describes what operations can be executed by certain resources
			For example: "alu : n2 n4 n5" means resource alu can execute node n2, n4 and n5. 
				resource and nodes are separeted by " : ", and nodes are space-separated.
		Any line with ";" at the front is a comment.

Output File: outputs are delivered into the results directory
	XXX.lp is the ILP formation of the problem which is the input to the CPLEX Solver
	XXX.results is the output generated by CPLEX Solver
	

This program only tells you how to start. In order to finish HW6, you have to
understand the details of the program. Don't underestimate the changes you need to make!
